This code was written following the FastBit Embedded Brain Academy on Udemy, found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/#instructor-1

The purpose of this repository is to:
  Learn GitHub
  Learn the basics of peripheral driver coding
  Utilize a more complicated dev-board than one used in course to force datasheet usage
